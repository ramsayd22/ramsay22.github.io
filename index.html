    <h1><em>About Me Portfolio</em></h1>

<p>
  My name is Darnell Ramsay. I'm thrilled to begin my software engineering journey with The Knowledge House. I'm currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. Unpon program completion, my aim is either work with an EdTech company or educate future software engineers.
